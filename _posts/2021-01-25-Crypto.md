title: Fun with Cryptography!
---
Today class resumes, and with it, a reintroduction to a favourite topic of mine, cryptography! 

Cryptography has been used for thousands of years to hide messages, with evidence that it was used as far back as 1900 BC in an Egyption Tomb. It has been used by spies and rogues, kings and emperors. One of the most well known ciphers named for it's most famous user - Julius Caesar in roughly 100BC! 

The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher that works by replacing a letter with another, encrypted letter. Caesar, for exmaple, used a shift by three cipher, so that A -> D, and B -> E and so on, wrapping around until each letter had a replacement. 

There of course is an obvious problem to this. This cipher relies on keeping the system a secret - once the system is known, it become vulnerable. For the Caesar cipher, even if his generals remained loyal and kept the secret, it is vulerable to frequency analysis. By recognising recurring letters and patterns, the plain text can be worked out by an attacker.

```Hcl Jhlzhy! Aopz alea pzu'a hss aoha zljbyl hmaly hss, pz pa?```

In the 1500's, Vigenere created what is said to be the first cipher that used a key to encrypt the plain text. In the Vignere cipher, a keyword is chosen and either repeated, or shortened to match the length of the plain text.The cipher text is produced by adding each chatacter with it's key equivilant, e.g A = 1, B = 2, and then modulo that number by 26.

For example:

```Plaintext: Thisfeelsalittlemoresecure

```
```Key: MyKeyMyKeyMyKeyMyKeyMyKeyM

```
```Encypted Text: Ffswdqcvwyxgdxjqkyvcecmypq
```

This too is not perfect, as it can be easily reversed!

This cipher is what I used once upon a time to encrypt my diary to prevent any snopoing eyes from reading it! I used online tools back then, but craving a little a mental exercise, I decided to put together a quick little tool for my past self to encrypt and decrypt their diary entries.

You can find the cipher [here on GitHub](https://github.com/HackaCat/VignereCipher)!

Enjoy!
